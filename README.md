# SolanaKt
Solana JSON RPC for kotlin using Ktor.

### Why you made it?
Actually this repository is fork of [Original repository](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/SolanaKT).
It's only made for android, and some method is not implemented or outdated and not maintananced.

### Will you support MultiPlatform?
idk
i will when i plan to use android
